# Textbook-Codes translated from R to Python3

## How to use this repository (the 'easy' way):
### Method 1 (Easiest, __no software installation!__)
- Travel to: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/neesarg123/Textbook-Codes/tree/main/
- Here you can choose to view any file you want to in an online jupyter notebook viewer
- Choose the file you want to edit or run
- Now if you want to __actually run__ the code, you will need to click on **"Execute on Binder"** option located to the **left** of the download button 
- This will open up an online executable session where you can edit and run the code cells
- **IMPORTANT NOTE:**
  - The packages/libraries used throughout the code files will **need to be installed first** 
  - To do this, you can insert a cell above the first cell. Then, run an installation line of this format: `! pip install [library name]`
### Method 2 
### Pre-requisites:
- Python 3.X
### Good-to-haves:
- Download Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
### Click on the green "Code" button
 - Download as ZIP 
 - If you have Jupyter Notebook/Lab downloaded:
    - Open it up!
    - Now make a new folder if you wish! 
    - Drag the files you want to edit/run onto Jupyter Notebook session!
